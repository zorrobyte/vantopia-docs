## Step 2: Vent Installation

**[YouTube Video ‚Üí](https://youtube.com)**  
**Personnel**: 2 person minimum  
**Time**: 2-4 hours

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This step requires using a ladder and climbing onto the roof of a van. Having a second person to help stabilize a ladder and assist is strongly advised.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Safety glasses are critical for this step as chips of metal are produced. You do not want a chip of metal in your eye.

### Tools Required
- Hammer
- Drill
- Step bit up to 1"
- Center punch
- Measuring tape
- Saw for metal (jig saw or sawzall)
- Metal cutting blade for saw
- Caulking gun
- Safety glasses
- Gloves

### Hardware Required (Customer Supplied)
- Vent template (supplied by Vantopia)
- Max Air vent or equivalent
- Butyl tape or equivalent
- Sikaflex or equivalent
- Rustoleum paint or equivalent

### Procedure

1. **Measure hole center point** using tape measure
   - Find the centerline of vehicle by measuring between fixed points (find two screw holes that are symmetric across centerline of vehicle)
   - Place template and confirm no interference with van ribs or structural members
   - Once template is centered and parallel to van ribs, mark center hole with marker
   
2. **Drill center hole** using step bit
   - Use center punch to mark center point of mark
   
3. **Align template** from top of vehicle
   - Once hole is drilled, move to the top of vehicle and align template with newly created hole
   - Make sure template is parallel to known rib
   
4. **Mark corners** of vent template with marker

5. **Drill the 4 corner points** with step bit
   - Make sure to place bit inside the square, not on the exact corner
   
6. **Cut between holes** using jig saw to cut the lines between the 4 holes just drilled

7. **Test fit vent** in newly created square hole
   - Check for fit and any interference
   - If interference, use jig saw to cut away
   
8. **Build up bedding** using butyl tape
   - Bring up to the height of the ribs or any protruding elements
   
9. **Apply Sikaflex** or equivalent to this bedding
   - Similar to putting icing on a cake
   - Use liberal amount of sealant (up to 1.5 tubes per vent is acceptable)
   
10. **Place vent** on bedding with sealant
    - Make sure vent is oriented properly (hinge on front side)
    - Ensure wires aren't trapped in sealant/bedding
    - Screw the provided screws around the perimeter using drill with Phillips bit
    - Screw until sealant appears to squeeze out from under the rim
    
11. **Apply another layer** of sealant around perimeter

12. **Apply dabs of sealant** to each fastener
    - Add about as much volume as a Hershey Kiss chocolate per fastener (it may seem like a lot but it's common practice)

### Tips and Tricks
- Make sure to check orientation of vent before installing (vent hinge should be on the front side)
- Make sure not to get wire pinched or caught in vent rim while installing
