**Time**: 2-4 hours

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This step requires using a ladder and climbing onto the roof of a van. Having a second person to help stabilize a ladder and assist is strongly advised.

   - Once template is centered and parallel to van ribs, mark center hole with marker
   
2. **Drill center hole** using step bit
   - Use center punch to mark center point of mark
   
3. **Align template** from top of vehicle
   - Once hole is drilled, move to the top of vehicle and align template with newly created hole
   - Make sure template is parallel to known rib
   
4. **Mark corners** of vent template with marker

5. **Drill the 4 corner points** with step bit
   - Make sure to place bit inside the square, not on the exact corner
   
6. **Cut between holes** using jig saw

7. **Test fit vent** in newly created square hole
   - Check for fit and any interference
   - If interference, use jig saw to cut away
   
8. **Build up bedding** using butyl tape
   - Bring up to the height of the ribs or any protruding elements
   
9. **Apply Sikaflex** or equivalent to this bedding
   - Use liberal amount of sealant (up to 1.5 tubes per vent is acceptable)
   
10. **Place vent** on bedding with sealant
    - Make sure vent is oriented properly (hinge on front side)
    - Ensure wires aren't trapped in sealant/bedding
    - Screw around the perimeter using drill with Phillips bit
    - Screw until sealant appears to squeeze out from under the rim
    
11. **Apply another layer** of sealant around perimeter

12. **Apply dabs of sealant** to each fastener

### Tips and Tricks
