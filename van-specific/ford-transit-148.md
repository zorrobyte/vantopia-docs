‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This step requires using a ladder and climbing onto the roof of a van. Having a second person to help stabilize a ladder and assist is strongly advised.

   - Check for fit and any interference
   - If interference, use jigsaw to cut away
   
8. **Build up bedding** using butyl tape
   - Bring up to height of ribs or protruding elements
   
9. **Apply Sikaflex** or equivalent to bedding
   - Similar to putting icing on a cake
