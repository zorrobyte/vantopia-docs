## üìã Installation Tips & Best Practices

### Electrical Installation
1. **Plan your layout** before starting - sketch out where everything will go
2. **Label all wires** - Use label maker or masking tape
3. **Test all circuits** before final assembly
4. **Use appropriate wire gauges** for amperage
5. **Install fuses** at appropriate ratings
6. **Keep DC and AC systems** separate
7. **Use strain relief** on all connections
8. **Check polarity** on all DC connections

### Plumbing Installation
1. **Plan your plumbing layout** considering access for maintenance
2. **Use shutoff valves** at key locations
3. **Test for leaks** before closing walls - use air pressure test
4. **Insulate pipes** in cold climates to prevent freezing
5. **Use proper slope** for drain lines (1/4" per foot minimum)
6. **Sanitize water system** before first use with bleach solution
7. **Consider winterization** if traveling in cold weather
8. **Use thread tape** (teflon) on all threaded connections

### Solar Installation
1. **Calculate power needs** before selecting panels
2. **Mount panels** with proper sealant to prevent leaks
3. **Check voltage ratings** of your power station
4. **Wire in series** for higher voltage (up to station max)
5. **Wire in parallel** for higher amperage
6. **Use MC4 connectors** for weatherproof connections
7. **Secure all cables** with UV-protected zip ties
8. **Test system** before final installation

### Safety Considerations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always disconnect power when working on electrical
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use proper safety glasses when cutting or drilling
